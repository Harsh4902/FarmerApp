# FarmerApp

The FarmerApp serves as an interface for farmers to submit their queries. It incorporates OTP-based authentication, allowing farmers to log in using their mobile numbers. To use the FarmerApp, farmers need to register first by providing their personal details, including their name, address, and phone number. The FarmerApp implements a three-level hierarchy for querying, enabling farmers to direct their questions to experts in specific fields and receive relevant answers. Furthermore, the FarmerApp supports multiple languages, allowing farmers to utilize it in their preferred language.
